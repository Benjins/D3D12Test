 - hack shader AST generation to have less stripped code
 - generate DXBC or DXIL directly to better exercise lower-level compiler
 - config so we can choose debug shaders or nah, which adapter to use, etc.
 - generate valid shader -> mutate it so it's incorrect, and verify that the compiler rejects it (i.e. doesn't crash)
 - generate compute shaders
 - actually run shaders, possibly will require some constraints on them to make sure pixel shader would actually run
